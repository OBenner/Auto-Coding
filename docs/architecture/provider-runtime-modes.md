# Provider Runtime Modes

This document describes how Auto Code runs agent sessions across Claude and
non-Claude providers after the runtime engine split. It is the current
compatibility contract for provider support.

## Summary

Auto Code remains Claude-first for full autonomous coding. The Claude Agent SDK
is still the only runtime that provides the complete agent surface Auto Code
depends on: tools, MCP servers, shell execution, filesystem edits, security
hooks, and session lifecycle behavior.

Other providers can still be useful, but they run through limited runtime modes:

- `analysis_only` for phases that only need text reasoning.
- `patch_proposal` for providers that return a structured unified diff proposal
  that Auto Code validates and applies locally.

The runtime engine fails fast when the selected provider cannot satisfy the
capabilities required by the current phase.

## Runtime Modes

| Runtime mode | Purpose | Required capabilities | Typical providers |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| `full_autonomous` | Full planner/coder/QA workflow with tools and filesystem access | Tools, MCP, shell, filesystem edits, workspace access, structured output | Claude Agent SDK |
| `patch_proposal` | Model proposes a patch; Auto Code validates and applies it locally | Text completion, structured output, local patch application | OpenAI, Google, LiteLLM, OpenRouter, ZhipuAI, Ollama |
| `analysis_only` | Text-only analysis without edits or tools | Text completion or streaming | OpenAI, Google, LiteLLM, OpenRouter, ZhipuAI, Ollama |

## Provider Compatibility Matrix

| Provider | Full autonomous coding | Analysis-only | Patch proposal | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| `claude` | Yes | Yes | Not needed | Uses the Claude Agent SDK path and keeps existing behavior. |
| `openai` | No | Limited | Limited | Direct OpenAI SDK sessions do not provide Auto Code's tool/MCP/security runtime. |
| `google` | No | Limited | Limited | Gemini sessions can stream text; tool/MCP parity is not implemented. |
| `litellm` | No | Limited | Limited | Gateway provider; capabilities depend on the routed model, but Auto Code treats it as text-only. |
| `openrouter` | No | Limited | Limited | OpenAI-compatible gateway; no native Auto Code tool runtime. |
| `zhipuai` | No | Limited | Limited | Text completion support only. |
| `ollama` | No | Limited | Limited | Local OpenAI-compatible models; useful for private text-only work. |

`Limited` means the provider is allowed only when the selected runtime mode does
not require missing capabilities. It does not imply the provider has been
validated for every agent phase or every model.

## Configuration

### Claude Default

No runtime override is required for the default full autonomous path:

```bash
AI_ENGINE_PROVIDER=claude
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

### Per-Agent Patch Proposal Mode

Use per-agent provider routing when Claude should remain available for phases
that need full autonomy, while coder subtasks use a limited provider:

```bash
AI_ENGINE_PROVIDER=claude

AGENT_PROVIDER_CODER=openai
AGENT_MODEL_CODER=gpt-4o
AGENT_RUNTIME_MODE_CODER=patch_proposal

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Command-Line Runtime Override

The CLI can override the runtime mode for a run:

```bash
python run.py --spec 001 --runtime-mode patch_proposal
```

Provider selection can also be supplied on the command line:

```bash
python run.py --spec 001 --provider openai --runtime-mode analysis_only
```

For a non-mutating analysis pass that does not enter the coding loop, use:

```bash
python run.py --spec 001 --provider openai --analyze
python run.py --spec 001 --provider openai --analyze --analysis-prompt "Review implementation risks"
```

The analysis output is saved under `artifacts/analysis_only_analysis_*.md`.

Use global non-Claude provider overrides carefully. A full build may still enter
planner, QA, or tool-dependent phases that require `full_autonomous`; those
phases will fail fast with a capability error instead of attempting an unsafe
fallback.

## Patch Proposal Contract

`patch_proposal` mode asks the model to return one JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "summary": "Short description of the proposed change",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "relative/path.py",
      "operation": "modify",
      "patch": "unified diff for this file"
    }
  ],
  "tests": ["suggested verification command"],
  "risks": ["known limitation or follow-up"]
}
```

Auto Code validates and applies the proposal locally:

- rejects absolute paths and parent traversal;
- rejects sensitive paths such as `.git`, `.env`, `.env.local`,
  `.env.production`, `.mcp.json`, and `.claude`;
- runs `git apply --check --whitespace=nowarn` before applying;
- saves patch artifacts in the spec artifacts directory;
- does not automatically run model-suggested test commands.

## Fail-Fast Behavior

Each runtime advertises capabilities such as `tools`, `mcp`, `filesystem_edits`,
`shell_commands`, `structured_output`, and `workspace_access`. Each agent phase
declares what it needs. If a provider/runtime pair cannot satisfy those
requirements, Auto Code reports a capability error before the session runs.

Examples:

- A non-Claude provider in `full_autonomous` mode fails before tool-dependent
  coding starts.
- A non-Claude provider in `analysis_only` mode is allowed only for phases that
  need text completion. During coding, Auto Code saves the text output to
  `artifacts/analysis_only_*.md`, leaves the subtask pending, and stops instead
  of pretending implementation succeeded.
- A non-Claude provider in `patch_proposal` mode can modify files only through
  a validated unified diff.

## Current Boundaries

This runtime engine is an integration boundary, not a generic replacement for
the Claude Agent SDK. The remaining work is a generic edit/tool runtime with MCP
translation and security parity, if the limited modes prove useful.
